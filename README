INSTALLATION

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

TESTING

This module requires the following module for thorough testing:

    Test::More

If the PERL_AUTHOR_TESTING environment variable is set to a true value,
the following optional test modules may be used to test the POD.

    Test::Pod
    Test::Pod::Coverage

ADVANCED TESTING

To test the module against the live Velib server the following
environment variables may be set:

	PERL_TESTING_WWW_VELIB_LOGIN=<your login number>
	PERL_TESTING_WWW_VELIB_PIN=<your pin>

UNINSTALLATION

This is a pure-Perl module. The following one-liner should print
out the canonical path of the file:

  perl -MWWW::Velib -le 'print $INC{"WWW/Velib.pm"}'

Just delete this file. There is also the question of the man page.
Finding that is left as an exercise to the reader, as is the
removal of WWW::Velib::{Map,Station,Trip}.

USAGE

use WWW::Velib;

my $v = WWW::Velib->new(login => '0000123456', password => '1234');

print "You have made ", $v->trips, " this month\n";

for my $t ($v->detail) {
	print "$t->{date} from $t->{from} to $t->{to}\n";
}

STATUS

This module is under active development.
