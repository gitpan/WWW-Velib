=head1 NAME

WWW::Velib::Station - Details of Velib' station bicycle and parking availability

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.01 of WWW::Velib::Station, released
2007-xx-xx.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use WWW::Velib::Station;

  my $s = WWW::Velib::Station->new(2007);
  print $s->available, $/; # hopefully a positive number

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new

Create a WWW::Velib::Station object. A single input parameter
is given, representing the station number.

=item make

Create a WWW::Velib::Station object, based on the geographic
information provided by WWW::Velib::Map. Not expected to be called
from client code.

=item load_v1

Create a WWW::Velib::Station object, based on locally-cached contents
of the geographic information provided by WWW::Velib::Map. Not
expected to be called from client code.

=item coords

Returns a two-element list containing the theta and phi coordinates
of the station.

=item distance_from

Returns the distance in metres of a station from the current station.
The result is rounded by default to the nearest 5 metres.

    my $depart; # two WWW::Velib::Station objects
    my $arrive;
    my $distance = $depart->distance_from($arrive);

To round off to another interval, specify the rounding as a second
parameter:

    my $dist_km = $depart->distance_from($arrive, 1000);

=item number

Returns the number (indentifier) of the station.

=item open

Indicates whether the station is open for business or not.

=item name

Returns the name of the station.

=item latitude

Returns the station's latitude, in degrees.

=item longitude

Returns the station's longitude, in degrees.

=item address

Returns the short address of the station.

=item full_address

Returns the full address of the station.

=item refresh

If a station has been built by loading a map, the following details
will not be loaded (it takes time to fetch a couple of thousand web
pages). This method will fetch the current status of the station
(bikes available, slots available). On a long-running process, may
be called repeatedly (at a suitable interval) to update the status.

=item available

Returns the number of bicycles available at the specified station.

=item total

Returns the total number of bicycle posts installed at the station.

=item free

Returns the number of bicycle posts that are able to receive a
bicycle.

=item disabled

Returns the number of bicycle posts that are locked or have a
locked bicycle attached.
